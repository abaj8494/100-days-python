# 100 Days of ...

PYTHON!

In order to become proficient at Machine Learning; creating models, using existing models and visualising everything in-between; I believe a strong foundation in Python is important.

As such, as of the 16th of March, 2025 I have embarked on a Quest to write Python code for the next 100 Days.

# Agenda

The agenda will be to follow [w3resource.com](https://w3resource.com/python-exercises/)'s incredible exercises that stress my thinking about lambda functions, maps, reversal's of tuples within tuples, and also provide me opportunities to study practise numpy / matplotlib skills and also combine all of the above in some more challenging _advanced_ problems.

# Directory Structure.

All of the files have been tangled out of my omniscient [abaj.ai](https://abaj.ai) website, and thus more commentary can be found [there](https://abaj.ai/projects/ccs/programming/languages/python). However, the `.py` files within each representative directory are (mostly) self-contained, and definitely so if you view them in order.

overarchingly I have split the problems into:
1. mastery --- contains the 100 Exercises for Mastery along with the JSON and RegEX exercises.
2. functional --- exercises for the functional programming paradigm; lambdas and filters
3. advanced. each of these problems took me the entire 1 hour I allocate to these exercises per day.

# Series

This project is part of a series, check out the rest of my *100 Days ...* series on my GitHub :D
